# 🆕 Latest Fixes (This Session)

## ✅ 1. Author Not Showing (FIXED)

### Problem:

* Posts did not show author name

### Solution:

* Added `user_id` in posts table
* Joined users table in backend

```sql
SELECT posts.*, users.name AS author_name, users.avatar AS author_avatar
FROM posts
LEFT JOIN users ON posts.user_id = users.id
```

---

## ✅ 2. Author Display in UI (FIXED)

### Updated:

* `Home.jsx` → shows author in cards
* `BlogDetails.jsx` → shows author below date

### Result:

* 👤 Author name visible
* 🔤 Avatar fallback (first letter)

---

## ✅ 3. Blog Page Missing Author (FIXED)

### Problem:

* Blog page (`/blog/:slug`) didn’t show author

### Fix:

* Updated `getPostBySlug` API with JOIN
* Added author UI in BlogDetails page

---

## ✅ 4. Sidebar "View Website" Not Highlighting (FIXED)

### Problem:

* Used `button` instead of `NavLink`

### Fix:

* Replaced with:

```jsx
<SidebarItem to="/" ... />
```

* Added support for:

```js
location.pathname.startsWith("/blog")
```

### Result:

* Sidebar now highlights correctly on:
  * `/`
  * `/blog/:slug`

---

## ✅ 5. Layout Improvements

* Author aligned properly
* Clean card structure
* Better spacing and UX
